###Advantages:
- Quick and easy-to-learn
- Free edition includes basic census data
- Export your static maps into presentation slides
- Share link or embed iframe to your interactive map

###Limitations:
- Maps are limited to the demographic data inside the tool.
- Polygon map boundaries are limited to state, county, census tract. The tool does not display municipal data for cities, towns, etc.
- Full census and historical data requires professional subscription.
- Pro subscription available through several academic libraries, but few public libraries.

###Quick overview of features

Start at the Social Explorer website (http://socialexplorer.com) and click on Maps. This tutorial demonstrates features available on the free edition.

Geographic boundaries automatically change with the zoom level. As you zoom in, the data levels automatically shift from state, to county, to census tract.
