# About This GitBook
*By [Jack Dougherty](../introduction/who.md), last updated February 28, 2017*

***Data Visualization for All*** is created with GitBook (http://gitbook.com), an open-source publishing platform that creates multiple editions (Web, PDF, ePUB, Mobi/Kindle), written in the easy-to-read Markdown format. See GitBook documentation (still a work-in-progress):
- GitBook features - http://gitbook.com
- GitBook.com platform Help Page - https://help.gitbook.com/
- GitBook Toolchain detailed documentation - http://toolchain.gitbook.com/

This book is hosted on the free GitBook.com platform. Updates are automatically generated when the author makes changes to the master branch of its linked GitHub repository: https://github.com/JackDougherty/
