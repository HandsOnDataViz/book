## Tool Review
- Pros:
  - Very easy-to-learn free mapping tool for beginners
  - Copy and paste data directly into the web interface, or upload with the spreadsheet template
  - Many data column labels are automatically recognized, and values are grouped into colored map markers

- Cons:
  - Free version limited to simple point maps, with few editing tools
  - Free version cannot process more than 250 rows of data
  - Must manually disable advertisements on your free maps
  - Cannot extract geocoded data to migrate to another tool
  - More advanced mapping features require an expensive license

## Tutorial

Let's build a simple point map with sample data. This tool is so easy that most readers probably will skip over this tutorial.

1) Right-click > Save As this link to [sample address data in CSV format](../sample-address-data-for-point-maps.csv), a generic spreadsheet table, and download it to your computer.

2) Open BatchGeo in your browser at http://batchgeo.com

3) Drag-and-drop the address file into BatchGeo. Or, open the CSV file with any spreadsheet tool, then copy and paste the address data into the web interface. Or, use the BatchGeo template if needed.

4) Click the Validate & Set Options button to review your data, or the Map Now button.

5) BatchGeo will attempt to geocode your address data and display an interactive point map. Colored markers include pop-up data windows.

6) Click the Save and Continue button. Add map title, select Public or Unlisted, and insert your email address.

7) BatchGeo emails you a link to edit your map, or to embed the iframe code in your own website. To learn more, go to the [Embed on Your Web](../../embed) chapters in this book.
