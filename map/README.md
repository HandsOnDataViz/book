# Map Your Data
*by [Jack Dougherty, Stacy Lam, and David Tatem](../introduction/who.md), last updated March 21, 2017*

Maps entice readers to explore your data story and develop a stronger sense of place. But good maps require careful thought about how to clearly communicate spatial concepts with your audience. This book features free tools to create interactive maps that you can embed in your website. In this chapter, you will learn how to:
- Practice key [principles of map design](design).
- Choose a map type that matches your data story and format, with tutorial links in the table below.
Beginners may start with easy-to-learn tools such as [BatchGeo](batchgeo) or [Google My Maps](mymaps), then move up to more powerful tools, such as [Leaflet](../leaflet), which require you to [Modify and Host Code Templates with GitHub](../github) or other web servers.
