# Know Your Data: Is It Good or Bad?

Before starting to create charts or maps, get to know your data.
- Where did it come from?
- Who compiled the data, and for what purpose?
- What do the data labels really mean?
- Ask yourself: Am I working with the *most* recent version, in the *best* available format?

Closely examine your data files to understand their meaning, sources of origin, and limitations.
